ABORTED,DEATH METAL,Belgium,https://www.facebook.com/Abortedofficial/,https://www.brutalassault.cz/en/band/aborted,"						Over the course of the group’s 20-plus career, they’ve transformed—via tongue-through-cheek and gross-out histrionics—from minor curio to the powerhouse from Flanders. The ascent through death metal’s maggot-infested, disease-ridden ranks didn’t come easy, however. Starting with 2003’s stab-to-the-face Goremageddon: The Saw and the Carnage Done, the finest Belgian export ABORTED crawled through some of the most disgusting sewers, serviced some of the wickedest human waste plants, and cleaned up Europe’s most brutal crime scenes. From there, it’s been nothing but golden showers and true reverence (by fan and peer alike) across six agonizingly good full-lengths. But Aborted aren’t that funny. They are, however, sickly serious and positively savage.

AFTER THE BURIAL,METAL HARDCORE PROGRESSIVE,United States,https://www.facebook.com/aftertheburial/,https://www.brutalassault.cz/en/band/after-the-burial,"						An uninhibited eight-stringed dual barrage of frenetic riffs and dynamic chord
progression is exactly what the crushing new AFTER THE BURIAL delivers with
pinpoint precision. This highly anticipated new offering is quickly going to raise the
bar for all others within the metal genre as this group effectively unleashes a frenzy of
jaw-dropping dual guitar dynamics that is backed by a captivating energy and groove
resulting in an overall unrelenting output of punishment. AFTER THE BURIAL is
hell-bent on forging their own unique path within the extreme metal genre and they
are well on their way to that very goal.

AFTER THE BURIAL are lauded for their technically impressive yet well structured style of songwriting and indeed this is an extreme metal hybrid that is a voracious assault on all the senses forcing your brain to fire on all cylinders in order to process the amount of material that is currently being pounded into your ears. This is thinking man’s metal and it’s not for the weak minded. The tech-wizardry is amped way up, the breakdowns are massive and face-melting and the vocal delivery is the most devastating.

AGNOSTIC FRONT,NY HC,United States, https://www.facebook.com/agnosticfront/,https://www.brutalassault.cz/en/band/agnostic-front,"						These rarely confronted and always respected leaders of hardcore were established as one of the meanest-sounding bands in the emerging punk genre, helping to initiate the term ""hardcore,"" and placing an entire uproar on the New York map by association. From the start, AGNOSTIC FRONT released a catalogue of fast and violent punk tunes consisting of distinctive and aggressive drumming, bass work, and a non-stop barrage of chaotic shouting. AGNOSTIC FRONT’s uncontrollable drumming and fuming guitars fill every minute like an onrushing storm of flailing limbs and incinerating transistors. The heavier paced balance between the energy and discipline of their earlier punk roots strikes a taut and vivid rock barrage that moshes in close formation.AGNOSTIC FRONT continues to be living embodiment that hardcore for life isn't an empty slogan or a musical dead end. No one is born with tattoos. No one's born hardcore. But when the ink or the music sets in, you're changed. Their latest offering reaffirms that AGNOSTIC FRONT as a band, still operates like a musical razor blade. Regardless of their history, the proof is simple: AGNOSTIC FRONT’s anthems are hard, cutting, and the remarkable music continues to broaden with every release. “We support UNITY! We despise ignorance and hatred within our scene. The only people we should be at war with is those who oppress us, not with each other. Unite! Fight the system! Not ourselves! Believe – Hardcore!”

ANAAL NATHRAKH,INDUSTRIAL BLACK GRIND,United Kingdom,https://www.facebook.com/Anaalnathrakhofficial/,https://www.brutalassault.cz/en/band/anaal-nathrakh,"						When writing about A New Kind Of Horror in the record's liner notes, ANAAL NATHRAKH vocalist Dave Hunt is succinct in his description: ""This is not a happy album, it is bitter, vengeful, sarcastic, sardonic, violent, terrified and horrified, terrifying and horrifying in equal measure.Above all, it is human, and all that that entails. It's as sincere as we could make it."" Those exposed to the ten tracks comprising the band's tenth full-length will be unable to deny the truth to these words, for lyrically, musically and sonically it is a punishing listen mired in darkness and seething with raw emotion.With multi-instrumentalist Mick Kenney pushing their distinctive hybrid of symphonic black metal, death metal, industrial and grindcore ever forward, Hunt draws lyrical inspiration primarily from the horrors of the First World War, contemporary politics, and the letters of D.H. Lawrence, creating one of the most powerful, timely and unique releases of 2018.

ANATHEMA,ALTERNATIVE ROCK,United Kingdom,http://www.anathemamusic.com,https://www.brutalassault.cz/en/band/anathema,"						The title for  ANATHEMA'S   eleventh full-length would also serve well in describing the Liverpool sextet’s uncompromising dedication to fearless artistry since forming in 1990. They’ve continually evolved by placing hope in the future – from leaving the underground scene they were fundamental in establishing to continually mesmerising the world with stargazing post-progressive alternative rock that knows no borders. Led by brothers Daniel and Vincent Cavanagh, along with drummer John Douglas, singer Lee Douglas, bassist Jamie Cavanagh and keyboardist/drummer Daniel Cardoso – this is a band that have forsaken all notion of expectation – highly evocative music simply pours out of them. And in a world of plastic conformists so desperately awaiting their moment of recognition, it’s a potent truth very much needed… Their latest album The Optimist was one of the best albums of 2017 and yet again uphold the bands name, which is built on the most soul-baring and introspective forms of artistic expression. Rightfully so, ANATHEMA'S shooting star looks set to burn perpetually brighter and brighter.

Whether it was inventing gore-grind (i.e. Reek of Putrefaction, Symphonies of Sickness) or creating the template for melodic death metal (i.e. Heartwork), CARCASS has always made records by which bars were set and rules were broken. pon the band’s dismantling in 1996, fans mourned the loss of the seminal act and longed that the group would return again one day. In 2007, the metal world got its wish as CARCASS reformed to play several sold-out reunion shows around the globe. Once again re-motivated to administer a shot of cynicism and infectious riffs into the arm of a sickly metal scene, founding members Bill Steer and Jeff Walker began writing what would become the latest output of their highly influential career, Surgical Steel. Only the choicest of cuts were made, and blood sweat and tears were shed to bring us a record worthy of the CARCASS legacy. In short, their latest Surgical Steel is just what the doctor ordered.

The mysterious and discreet man behind the pentagon – or the Brutagram as his fans would call it – evokes an encounter between Justice beats and the universe of John Carpenter.



Listening to his home-made EPs, however, one would rather bet on a metalhead background, a crush for Dario Argento and a force-fed religious education. This would explain his penchant for the occult, his passion for kitsch sounds and his adoration for all kinds of enjoyment. CARPENTER BRUT pays tribute to the post-hippie/pre-AIDS culture that then set the basis of electro and metal to give us a unique, violent and crazy 80s revival sound.Into the brutagram!

THE CONTORTIONIST,PROGRESSIVE METAL,United States,https://www.facebook.com/thecontortionist/,https://www.brutalassault.cz/en/band/the-contortionist,"THE CONTORTIONIST represents fearlessness in musical expression, designed to please artist as much as audience. This band makes progressive metal music, anchored in the heavy sounds that first drew the individual players to the stage, yet unmoored by convention or expectation.

On their recent output Clairvoyant, the band’s distinctive fingerprints remain, even as their atmospheric flourishes broaden to encompass ever-richer textures and mine the beauty of simplicity. 

For the entirety of their career, THE CONTORTIONIST has proven capable of being been equally at home on tour with Deftones, Periphery, or Between The Buried And Me, thanks to their dynamic combination of metal’s blunt precision with the adventurous spirit of prog-rock heroes like Rush and King Crimson. THE CONTORTIONIST integrates seemingly disparate worlds to create their own sound, with a focus on tone, vibe, color, and atmosphere. 

THE CONTORTIONIST ultimately prove to have as much in common with the psychedelic experimentation of later Opeth or Tool and even the textured melodicism of Sigur Ros as they do technical heavy music, but they’ve never sacrificed urgent impact. Critics and fans admire their intelligent approach to the crushing riffs of tech-metal, which becomes more vibrant with elements of ambitious post rock and jazzy / fusion-infused virtuosity. Even when angular riffs, odd time signatures, and devastating breakdowns give way to hypnotic,ethereal, and trancelike musical meditations, THE CONTORTIONIST are never lacking in total power.

Dawson’s career with COVEN continued intermittently through the decades. She also worked in Hollywood and as a backup singer.

The band uses everything from running water, human bones, reconstructed swords and shields up to ancient frame drums and bronze rings in the songs. 
The lyrics contain original texts from rune stones and preserved spear shafts, amulets and other artifacts. Furthermore poems, which either deal with historical events or are translations/ interpretations of the originals. 
HEILUNG tries to connect the listener to the time before Christianity and its political offsprings raped and burned itself into the northern European mentality. HEILUNG means healing which also describes the core of their sound. It is supposed to leave the listener eased and relaxed after a sometimes turbulent musical journey.

HELLHAMMER - TRIUMPH OF DEATH,FIRST WAVE BLACK METAL,Switzerland,https://fischerisdead.blogspot.com,https://www.brutalassault.cz/en/band/hellhammer-triumph-of-death,"A Tribute To HellhammerHELLHAMMER existed for a mere two years, from May 1982 to May 1984. During this time, the band wrote material for three demos, one 12"" EP, and the legendary Death Metal compilation album, along with a number of unrecorded songs.In light of HELLHAMMER's now mythically iconic status in the global metal scene, it is almost inconceivable that most of this music has never been performed life. HELLHAMMER's successor group, CELTIC FROST, formed by ex-HELLHAMMER members Tom Gabriel Warrior and Martin Eric Ain, initially played two of HELLHAMMER's songs but soon abandoned this habit due to the band rapidly developing its own material. Tom Gabriel Warrior's TRIPTYKON, founded in 2008, have played one or the other rare HELLHAMMER song during special occasions. The vast body of HELLHAMMER's work remains unperformed, however.Until now.The resurrection of the music of HELLHAMMER has been an idea Tom Gabriel Warrior and Martin Eric Ain have discussed for many years, sparked not least by their renewed collaboration in the reformed CELTIC FROST in the 2000s and by the years of work on Warrior's second book Only Death Is Real (2009), which details the history of HELLHAMMER and early CELTIC FROST.Tom Gabriel Warrior: Hellhammer will never return and will never be reformed. It is absolutely impossible to reform a band so closely linked to a very specific and unique period in time. I never considered it, no matter how substantial the offers that were pitched to me over the years. But Hellhammer's music exists, and it is an extremely important part of my life's path. And I would like to play it onstage before my demise.The first steps towards the realization of TRIUMPH OF DEATH, named after Hellhammer's most infamous song and intended to be a very respectful and authentic tribute to Hellhammer, were taken years ago. TRIUMPH OF DEATH consists of some of Warrior's closest friends; individuals who not only love this music but truly understand it. The line-up emulates Hellhammer's final incarnation of April/May 1984, when the group had added an additional guitarist.TRIUMPH OF DEATH will commence playing Hellhammer's music onstage in 2019. It is a an open-ended project, but the band will only play select concerts. Apart from considerations regarding the release of an occasional live EP, TRIUMPH OF DEATH will not record any new music but is solely dedicated to performing both well-known and obscure Hellhammer songs. The project is based in Zurich, Switzerland.TRIUMPH OF DEATH is:Tom Gabriel Warrior (Hellhammer, Celtic Frost, Triptykon, Niryth) - voice/guitarMia Wallace (Niryth, The True Endless, Kirlian Camera) - bassMichael Zech (Secrets Of The Moon, Odem Arcarum) - guitar/vocalsAlessandro Comerio (Forgotten Tomb, The True Endless, Hiems) - drums

Their music has gone through many stages of transformation and mutation up until today, but the core of the band has remained unchanged for over 16 years. The band has had a mantra of exploration and experimentation in their approach to songwriting, and is hard to define by limiting genres. Overall it can best be described as a bastardization of rock and electronica with influences from jazz, metal and more. Still, the focus lies on what goes in the ear. The music has been called both atmospheric and cinematic, often with climactic builds and layers of detail. It can be both emotional and oppressive, and more often than not; cloaked in a discomforting darkness.MANES went onto incredible path of artistic exploration started years ago with the mythical album Vilosophe. For MANES, there's no limit, music is just a sacred journey in the territory of pure inspiration, recently finding its destination somewhere between electronic sounds, rock, trip-hop, ambient, and, as always, displaying fantastic and graceful songwriting.

The band spawned in the realm of musicians/artists such as Black Sabbath, Frank Zappa, The Dictators and The Stooges. The earliest lineup consisted of Wino, Mark Laue (Bass), John Reese (Guitars) and Dave Flood (Drums). In 1983, Wino took over vocals duties and the band became a 3-piece to record the Sodden Jackal EP. The band broke up in the late 80s after Wino moved to California to join Saint Vitus. At that time, a German label, Hellhound Records, and the booking agency that had signed Saint Vitus, released The Obsessed, originally recorded in 1985, prompting Wino to reform THE OBSESSED. After multiple lineup changes the band signed to Columbia Records in 1994 to release their third and final album, The Church Within. Despite highly acclaimed reviews, THE OBSESSED would breakup once again following the release, seeing Wino forming Spirit Caravan (Then Shine) and other projects.Wino announced the full-time return of THE OBSESSED in March 2016 and the band’s official signing to Relapse Records to record the follow up to The Church Within. The following year the band unleashed Sacred, their first studio album in over 20 years. With renewed energy and purpose, THE OBSESSED sounds heavier and more relevant than ever before. On Sacred, the band doubles down on enormous, heaving riffs and pummeling low-end across 12 tracks of eternal doom. Rounded out by Wino’s lyrical honesty and iconic throaty vocals, Sacred is an album that further pushes THE OBSESSED into the annals of heavy metal history, well worth the two-plus decade wait. The band will do a couple of gigs in Europe in 2019, so do not miss this opportunity!

No matter if it is the scorching first single ‘Seismic Abyss’, the dynamic ‘Catastrophic Retribution’, ‘Parasitic Horrors’ or ‘Reanimating Pathogen’, SKELETAL REMAINS blend elements of death and thrash metal with blazing solos uniting influences from such a melodic master like James Murphy (Death, Cancer, Obituary, Testament) to the divebombing assault of Rick Rozz (Death, Massacre). “The album is basically the next step up for us! It’s a bit more technical compared to our first two albums and we have also used seven string guitars for some songs to add a heavier edge at times, but overall it has the same sound and feeling of our previous releases: Old school death metal from the late 80s and early 90s with a little bit of our own taste added to it!” So make sure to listen to Devouring Mortality as it might be one of 2018’s finest slabs of death metal and totally lives up to the band’s perspective.

SLÆGT,BLACKENED HEAVY METAL,Denmark,https://www.facebook.com/Slaegt/,https://www.brutalassault.cz/en/band/slaegt,"SLÆGT from Copenhagen, Denmark, is the sound and essence of four hearts and minds locking together and joining forces towards the unknown. The band has found their very own, unique style of playing heavy metal. Stylistically influences are drawn from a broad spectrum of such diverse movements as the NWOBHM, the black metal scene(s) of the 80’s and 90’s and everything in between and beyond. SLÆGT plays an epic blackened heavy metal but without any kind of limitation when approaching the style. They explore unseen territories and go beyond the obvious norms of heavy metal, which makes them sound fresh and progressive. The darkness within the riffs and lyrics flows with dark blasts of energy. One of the hottest label of the recent times Ván Records released their highly acclaimed debut full length Domus Mysterium and now the band is once again dimming lights and opening fire with the brand new full-length The Wheel. A challenging, yet soothing record that perfectly picks up the thread from the previous effort. Discover the beautiful and damned sons, from the house of mysteries, doing all they can to escape the boundaries of the wheel!

SODOM,THRASH METAL,Germany,http://www.sodomized.info,https://www.brutalassault.cz/en/band/sodom,"						Pioneers of thrash metal, leading force in the Teutonic big 4 formed already back in 1981!
While rumours are still flying thick and fast in the media, Tom Angelripper has already announced the new line-up of his band SODOM:  Husky (Asphyx, Desaster) is set to man the drum kit, Frank Blackfire  (ex-Sodom, ex-Kreator, Frank Blackfire, Assassin) and Yorck Segatz  (Beyondition) have been enlisted on guitars. SODOM have already released  seminal albums such as Persecution Mania, the live cut Mortal Way Of  Live and the highly successful Agent Orange with Frank Blackfire. As he  had hinted at the beginning of the year, Tom has opted for a line-up  featuring two guitarists, an absolute novelty for SODOM. “Two guitarists  allow us much more possibilities live, so we will be able to play  tracks in future that we weren’t able to perform as a trio,” the SODOM vocalist/bassist explains his motives. In line with these new  possibilities, the thrash act has already started to put together a setlist for the upcoming shows with all important classics as well as  rare numbers that had never or only rarely been heard at their gigs.

SOILWORK,MELODIC GROOVE METAL,Sweden,https://www.soilwork.org,https://www.brutalassault.cz/en/band/soilwork,"SOILWORK has been around, in one form or another, for twenty years now. Some people say that they haven’t made anything worth listening to after Steelbath Suicide. Some have only heard Stabbing The Drama. Some think The Living Infinite was quite epic. It’s all good. At this point in a band’s career, you can either choose the nostalgia route, playing old albums in their entirety, because that makes an easy package for promoters to sell. And the music industry is a lot about selling these days.You can also choose to ignore reality, and do what you really want to do, and try to evolve and create something new and different. Because that’s the reason you started doing this in the first place, right? To make some sort of impression somewhere, to perhaps make someone feel a bit moved or confused or inspired, or just to create something that would keep resonating somewhere in the ether, perhaps to become an ignored aural wraith, but perhaps also to be remembered. Because there will always be another version of reality, and some of us will always try to find a way out of it. Hence the new album Verkligheten. Verkligheten is the Swedish word for reality, the entity that we’re all trying to escape from. Verkligheten is our attempt to try and go somewhere else, to express all those things that are born in between hypnagogic states and frenzies of hyperrealism. Verkligheten is the otherworldliness of Swedish suburban anxiety, accompanied by blastbeats and slide guitars.

TAAKE,BLACK METAL,Norway,https://www.facebook.com/taakeofficial/,https://www.brutalassault.cz/en/band/taake,"						Cold Norwegian fog will make your bones shiver..as TAAKE takes over Brutal Assault! From the rugged, rain-swept coastline of Bjoergvin, enclosed within the looming embrace of seven mountains, emerges this unmerciful act, spawning 7 records thus far, all of them rising from the gloom like the beacon of traditional black metal. Their metal is fresh, yet traditional in spirit. It is familiar to the ear, yet unexpectedly proceeds to wind its sinuous and unpredictable way through a soundscape that only a mother could love. A soundscape underscored by a nasty groove, that at times can appear deceptively playful. TAAKE still today manages to stay relevant and at the forefront of the genre, and, true to form, Hoest, who plays every instrument on their latest album “Kong Vinter” himself, has ensured that the album is imbued with the unique TAAKE sound whilst at the same time developing it further.

TANKARD,ALCOHOLIC THRASH METAL,Germany,http://www.tankard.info,https://www.brutalassault.cz/en/band/tankard,"						In 1982, four longhaired metal maniacs from Frankfurt am Main in Germany decided to found a band.. Nobody expected them to still be going 35 years later, not to mention being at the top of the German thrash metal scene and a part of the Teutonic BIG 4! But they are still alive and kicking, never breaking up and always keeping to hold their flag of beer thrash metal high! Not one day dead despite many terrible hangovers... Indeed, TANKARD are the founders of alcoholic metal, and probably the band, that has dedicated the most effort into converting unrestrained beer drinking into an art form!

TAPHOS,DEATH METAL,Denmark,https://www.facebook.com/taphosdeath/,https://www.brutalassault.cz/en/band/taphos,"						Hailing from the same Danish scene as Undergang and Phrenelith, TAPHOS create a classic - and classically gutted - style of Metal of Death. Their first recording, Demo MMXVI, possessed a darkly thrashing sound highly reminiscent of turn-of-the-'90s death metal on both sides of the Atlantic, as resolutely Scandinavian as it was American, its filthy propulsion as palatably fresh as it was authentically ancient. On the subsequent two-song EP, TAPHOS' sound becomes more world-eating, their songwriting aims more epic whilst not losing the raw fury of their beginnings. Now, with debut full lenght Come Ethereal Somberness, they shift into something hammering and hideous yet nevertheless invoke clarity that never castrates their attack. The quartet render each of these seven central compositions (bookended by moody instrumentals) a story unto itself.

For over three decades, the Bay Area quintet - Chuck Billy [vocals], Eric Peterson [guitar], Alex Skolnick [guitar], Steve DiGiorgio [bass], and Gene Hoglan [drums] has consistently delivered unadulterated, unbridled, and unbreakable metal in its purest form without compromise or any signs of slowing down. Over the course of seminal releases ranging from The Legacy and Practice What You Preach to The Gathering and The Formation of Damnation, TESTAMENT continuosly show teeth and unparalleled force of their music. At Brutal Assault 2019 the band returns with highly acclaimed new record Brotherhood of the Snake and promises to deliver the wildest TESTAMENT show up to date!

THERION,SYMPHONIC METAL,Sweden,http://therion.se,https://www.brutalassault.cz/en/band/therion,"						The band was founded in 1987 by Christofer Johnsson and started off with recoding a few demos and the mini LP in the vein of Swedish death metal. Indeed, THERION began as a very creative Death Metal band, pushing limits of the contemporary sound and grew beyond themselves. In the course of the years, the bands style developed in a quite unique way and between 1991 and 1996 THERION released groundbreaking records, one being more special than the other. After a few lineup changes, making Christofer the only original member to remain, THERION released Theli, which would be the ultimate breakthrough for the band. At this time THERION turned towards a more opera-like, progressive and even orchestral sound which made them famous through the world.



And now they're coming to Brutal Assault with a special Theli show!

VAMPILLIA,BRUTAL ORCHESTRA,Japan,http://vampillia.com/,https://www.brutalassault.cz/en/band/vampillia,"						Outstanding, shocking, unbelievable, breathtaking and many more is the Japanese self-described “brutal orchestra” VAMPILLIA. It’s not just a band, it’s something that you have to experience in order to believe it. Each record of this ensemble represents something different, just as their shows do, which you can call an emotional roller-coaster. After their successful tour with Alcest, Brutal Assault will give another warm welcome to these Japanese freaks in Czech Republic! It’s not every day that you’re hit with a “brutal orchestra” of ten (or often more) people, including electronics, two drummers and a piano player, mixing classical pieces and weird pop with brutal sludge and hardcore... It’s chaos, but it’s a beautiful chaos that works only when you listen to it, it’s an alien transmission that jumbles up your senses, prevents you from making any sense when talking about it, and it makes you feel paralysed and super powerful at the same time.

VARGRAV,BLACK METAL,Finland,https://www.facebook.com/Vargravofficial/,https://www.brutalassault.cz/en/band/vargrav,"						A shady veil of mystery is covering this group and BA 2019 will be only one of the very few appearances of the band in 2019. Their only album, bearing the ominous and apt title of Netherstorm, is a blizzard-blown blast from the ancient past, when ""symphonic black metal"" was not yet a dirty word to many. VARGRAV create a swarming, densely layered maelstrom of medieval majesty and moonlit madness. Tangibly physical without sacrificing the finer nuances of synth layering, Netherstorm sweeps grandly across a cobwebbed landscape, distant ruins becoming the very listener's landscape. It's truly timeless magick, evoking the visionary works of old Obtained Enslavement, Dimmu Borgir, Abigor, Limbonic Art, and especially early Emperor.. don't miss the rare opportunity to witness their magic live at BA!

VENOM PRISON,DEATH METAL HARDCORE,United Kingdom,https://www.venomprison.com,https://www.brutalassault.cz/en/band/venom-prison,"The cover of VENOM PRISON's debut album, Animus, brings the theme of the album to life in the form of an original Renaissance-style painting by artist Eliran Kantor depicting a man shackled and surrounded by women. Blood drips from between his legs as a woman shoves his severed genitals into his mouth. Animus has propelled VENOM PRISON, since the LP's release last year, from utter anonymity to sudden acclaim. Vocalist and front women Larrisa Stupar and her bandmates crafted a 34-minute horror show of breakdowns and beatdowns that incorporates elements of death metal and hardcore but sounds less like deathcore than something entirely new. The band's been on tour pretty much constantly since the release of the album and will come to crush Brutal Assault fans as well!

Their ten-tracks debut album ""Catastrophic Anonymous"" features vocal contributions from Attila Csihar (Sunn o))), Mayhem) and Chip King (The Body).VMO's overall sound is a multi-headed beast that can't be pitched in a single line. ""Catastrophic Anonymous"" roots are indubitably those of a harsh record, with expansive black metal guitars powered by Extreme Precautions-style glitchy textures & brain-melting drum machine work as well as Pete Swanson's noisy soundscapes. Then it also covers a wide range of genres - flirting with industrial techno, post-rock or drone - while always sounding effortlessly natural. Mastered by James Plotkin (Khanate, Atomsmasher) and illustrated by french artist Metastazis, ""Catastrophic Anonymous"" is the fruit of boundary-pushing people, and a refreshing, spectacular experience.

This has provided Anneke with a huge catalogue to choose from as a live performer, but it has also created a certain amount of confusion amongst her fans which has led to the creation of a new band, VUUR, a new band that features some of the best heavy metal players in the Netherlands.In early 2016, Anneke decided for the sake of clarity to narrow her musical focus, choosing to go in a folk acoustic direction as a solo artist and in a heavy progressive metal direction as a band vocalist. The name VUUR - translated from Dutch as ""fire"", which can also be interpreted to mean ""passion"" or ""drive"" - was chosen as a moniker to represent Anneke's metal side and showcase her heavy progressive music.

WOJO became an iron sureness not only on the hardcore field and not just because of their music, but also because of their attitude and distinguished performance full of blasting energy of their frontwoman Candace Kucsulain. Their latest output No Once Can Save You From Yourself follows the mesh of metallic venom and concrete fury of hardcore/punk that the band is known for, 13 solid tracks of highly anticipated hard beating poetic thunder people have come to expect from the band.

Since then the band’s already powerful attack became even more sinister and morose, yet more aggressive and pummeling.

On their third full-length Krighsu the fast rising Spanish Sci-Fi tech death prodigies are telling a dystopian cosmic story with lyrics and music joined into an overarching concept. Odd-time signatures, avalanches of breaks and complex rhythmical as well as melodic patterns will excite every aficionado of extreme technicality, while growls down-tuned strings and double-bass assaults will more than satisfy extreme metal connoisseurs. While being outstandingly skilled musicians WORMED are avoiding any self-indulgent show of prowess for its own sake. Instead the five-piece from Madrid clearly lays its emphasis on creating atmospheric songs, which develop and grow along the underlying story.

A distinctive, sublime mix of Chinese folk music and black metal, employing traditional instruments such as the guzheng, bamboo flute or the erhu and expertly merging them with guitar-led extremity, it creates a completely alien mood which nevertheless will still feel strangely welcoming and familiar.For Westerners, a clumsy but still apt metaphor to describe it might be as if Wolves In The Throne Room were thrown in the middle of a fight scene from any Zhang Yimou epic.
